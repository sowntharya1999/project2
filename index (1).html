  <h3>Background Information</h3>
  <p>
  	In a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">Stroop effect</a></b>, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to read out the color of the ink in which the word is printed.</p>
	<p>The two condidtions of the experiment are:
    <p>1. Congruent words condition 2. Incongruent words condition.
    <p>	1. In the congruent words condition, the words given in table 1 have colors corresponding to their names,for example <span style="color:red;">RED</span>, <span style="color:blue;">BLUE</span>. 
	<p> 2. In the incongruent words condition, the color of the words do not correspond to their name in table 2, for example <span style="color:red;">GREEN</span>, <span style="color:blue;">YELLOW</span>. 
  </p>

  <h3>Questions For Investigation</h3>
  <p>
  	<b>1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?</b>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  	<b>Independent variable:</b> A variable whose value or any other property isn't affected by the value or characteristic of another variable, but can manipulate the outcome of dependent variables is called an independent variable.  The independent variable in this context is the condition provided to satisfy congruency( Whether name of word corresponds to it's color ).
	</p>
  <p class="answer">
  	<b>Dependent variable:</b> A dependent variable is manipulated during an experiment to obatin desired results or to observe the effects of an independent variable. The dependent variable here is the time it takes to name the color of words in the equally-sized list.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
  	<b>2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.</b>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  <p><b>Null  Hypothesis</b></p>
    The null hypotheses implies that the test is one-tailed since the mean color recognition time for congruent words is equal to or more than that of incongruent words.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  	H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>C</sub> ≥ μ<sub>I</sub>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  	where μ is a population mean, the subscript "C" represents the congruent words condition, and the subscript "I" represents the incongruent words condition.
  </p>
  <p><b>Alternative hypothesis</b></p>
  <p>The alternative hypothesis, denoted by H1 or Ha, is the hypothesis that sample observations are influenced by some non-random cause. It should state that the mean of congruent words is less than that of the mean of incongruent words.</p>
  <p class="answer">
  	H<sub>A</sub>: μ<sub>C</sub> &#60; μ<sub>I</sub>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  <p><b>One Tailed Dependent Sample t-test</b></p>
    A one-tailed, dependent samples t-test comparing the difference in means (the time to name the ink colors for congruent words and incongruent words) should be performed. With this test, we seek to determine whether there is enough evidence in the provided sample of data to infer that the congruent words mean color recognition time is less than the incongruent words mean color recognition time for the entire population and not just the sample data.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  <p><b>Example</b></p>
    A t-test is appropriate because the population variance is unknown and the sample size is less than 30. When the sample size is less than 30, the sample data no longer approximate a normal distribution, which makes the use of a Z-value inappropriate.<sup><a href="http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/t-distribution.aspx" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The following assumptions are required for t-tests for dependent means:<sup><a href="http://www.psychology.emory.edu/clinical/bliwise/Tutorials/TOM/meanstests/assump.htm" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
    <ul class="answer">
	<p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
      <li>Interval or ratio scale of measurement (approximately interval)</li>
      <li>Random sampling from a defined population</li>
      <li>Samples or sets of data used to produce the difference scores are linked in the population through repeated measurement, natural association, or matching</li>
      <li>Scores are normally distributed in the population; difference scores are normally distributed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    A one-tailed test is appropriate under the assumption that incongruent word conditions will not improve recognition times, which is intuitive. The one-tailed test allows for a more scrutinous examination of the negative impact of incongruent word conditions on recognition times.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    The t-test should be of the dependent samples variety because the same subject is exposed to two conditions and tested for each, which are the defining criteria for "within-subjects" or "repeated-measures" statistical tests.<sup><a href="https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/dependent-t-test-statistical-guide.php" target="_blank">3</a></sup>

  <p>This is the frequency distribution or histogram of congruent and incongruent Stroop Test data with data in x-axis and frequency in y-axis.</p>
  	<b>5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?</b>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    α = .01
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    degrees of freedom = 23
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    t<sub>crit</sub> = -2.50
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    t = -8.02
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    p-value = &#60; .0001
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    At the 99% confidence level (α = .01) and 23 degrees of freedom, the critical statistic value for a one-tailed test in the negative direction is -2.5. The calculated t-statistic for the difference in color recognition time means of the congruent and incongruent word data is -8.02. Since the t-statistic is in the critical region, the null hypothesis is rejected. With the data presented, it is very unlikely that the 7.96 second difference in mean time for color recognition for the congruent data vs. the incongruent data is obtained if the two means are actually the same (or if μ<sub>C</sub> > μ<sub>I</sub>). By conventional criteria, this difference is considered to be extremely statistically significant.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    There is sufficient evidence at the α = .01 level of significance to support the claim that it takes less time to recognize the color of words with the congruent condition compared to words with the incongruent condition.
  </p>
  <p>
  	<b>6. Optional: What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect? Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!</b>
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  	My hypothesis for the effects observed is that the brain concentrates on reading the name of the word more than identifying it's color when the eyes are presented with a colored word. To recognize a color, one has to surpass the brain's natural tendency of reading the word. This override takes time and is likely not always successful, which implies re-analyzing a word after the error is recognized, which costs more time.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
    Numerical/Physical size Stroop tasks, where numerical values and physical size are the factors that contribute to congruency/incongruency, results in a similar effect. It takes longer to recognize the number and physical size (two separate tasks) of small numbers that have a large physical size and large numbers that have a small physical size.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_Stroop_effect" target="_blank">4</a></sup>
